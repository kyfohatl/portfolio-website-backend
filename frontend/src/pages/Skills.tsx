            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
              Studied at Computer Science (Bsc) at The University of Melbourne from 2018-2021, graduating with
              a gpa of 5.8, equivalent to a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of 77.25.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the core Computer Science subject, I also took a number of biology subjects (Chemistry,
              Biochemistry, Genetics, Human Physiology and Anatomy), as I have an interest in simulating biological
              systems in a virtual environment, and believe that combining computing with biology is a fascinating
              field of study.

            <h3>Pharmacy Assistant</h3>

              I started working at Star Pharmacy before I began my university studies and continued to work there
              throughout my degree, in a part-time capacity. Though initially I felt uncomfortable in a customer-
              facing position, this role greatly helped me develope my people and communication skills, and over
              the years I found it to be a refreshing change from my studies, which was mostly at a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked both in a Pharmacy Assistant role, and a Medication Delivery role, and had the opportunity
              to work in multiple stores (Kew and Middle Park). I believe that my consistent and professional
              service played a significant role in the flourishing and expansion the delivery side of the business.
              There were quite a few instances of satisfied customers who recommended the service to their
              neighbors, whom I consequently delivered to.
